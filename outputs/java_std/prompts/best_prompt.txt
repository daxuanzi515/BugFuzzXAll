/* The document outlines the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) and Java Development Kit (JDK). Java SE forms the groundwork for the Java platform and is designed for general-purpose computing. It covers foundational APIs, data transfer, user interface toolkits, logging, security, and more. 

The JDK, which may not be available in all Java SE platform implementations, includes tool-specific functions like system Java compiler, the SunPKCS11 security provider, JMX graphical tool, management interfaces for the JVM, and functionalities for creating run-time images.

Each API comes with a module that starts with either java (in Java SE) or jdk (in JDK). Each module corresponds to a specific function, ranging from data transfer to security to xml processing in Java SE, or from system compiler to networking API in JDK.

A few examples of modules are:

1. java.compiler, which is responsible for the language model, annotation processing, and Java Compiler APIs.
2. java.desktop, which covers AWT and Swing user interface toolkits, and APIs for accessibility, audio, imaging, printing, and JavaBeans.
3. jdk.compiler, which looks after the implementation of the system Java compiler and its command line equivalent, javac.
4. jdk.javadoc, which is responsible for the system documentation tool and its command-line equivalent, javadoc.

The two sections combined provide an in-depth look at the components, functionality, and intricate workings of the Java SE Platform and the JDK. */
