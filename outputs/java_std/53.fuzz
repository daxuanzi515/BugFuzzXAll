This class is the essential starting point for building an object oriented program. The Graph
class is the foundation upon which all the graph-related program design takes place. In other
words, this is the class that implements the Graph interface and its various abstractions,
along with the associated functions that make up its core. In fact, the Graph class is a
generalization of the class weâ€™ve built so far; if we were to replace this Graph class with a
LinkedList, we would get the simplest possible Graph.

Each Graph requires a way to store its vertices and edges. The addVertex and addEdge
functions do just that, although a number of other functions exist. In fact,
