/* The "typedef" declaration in C language is used to create an alias for an existing data type. This means it designates a new name for an existing type which can be used in place of the complex type name. It doesn't introduce new types, instead, it introduces synonyms for existing types. 

It's often leveraged to simplify the syntax of complex declarations like arrays, functions, structures etc. For example, "typedef int int_t;" declares "int_t" as an alias for the type "int". Multiple aliases can be declared in a single line, for example, "typedef char char_t, *char_p, (*fp)(void);".

This strategy of introducing new names into the ordinary namespace can help in making the code cleaner, easier to understand and manage. In addition, system-dependent types are often exposed as typedef names in libraries for consistency and compatibility.

One key point to note here is that typedef does not affect the storage or linkage of the types, in other words, it doesn't change the type, it creates a new, alternate name for it. 

Some important considerations on usage include:
1. The array size in the typedef has to be at block scope for Variable length arrays(VLAs).
2. Typedef can be used to alias incomplete types which may be completed later.
3. Libraries often use typedef to create system or configuration-dependent types to present a consistent interface to the users. */
