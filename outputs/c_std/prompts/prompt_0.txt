/* The C Standard Library is a set of functions, macros, and types implemented via headers that help perform common programming tasks. These headers include:

<assert.h>: For testing assumptions (assertions) at runtime.
<complex.h>: To perform complex number arithmetic.
<ctype.h>: To classify characters into several types.
<errno.h>: To report error conditions.
<fenv.h>: To manage the floating-point environment.
<float.h>: To provide limits of floating-point types.
<inttypes.h>: To convert integer types formats.
<iso646.h>: For alternative operator spellings.
<limits.h>: To determine the ranges of integer types.
<locale.h>: For localization utilities.
<math.h>: To perform common mathematical functions.
<setjmp.h>: For non-local jumps.
<signal.h>: For signal handling.
<stdalign.h>: For alignas and alignof convenience macros.
<stdarg.h>: For handling variable arguments.
<stdatomic.h>: For atomic operations.
<stdbit.h>: To work with byte and bit representations of types.
<stdbool.h>: For boolean types.
<stdckdint.h>: For checked integer arithmetic.
<stddef.h>: For common macro definitions.
<stdint.h>: For fixed-width integer types.
<stdio.h>: For input/output functionality.
<stdlib.h>: For general utilities like memory management, program utilities, string conversions, etc.
<stdnoreturn.h>: For noreturn convenience macro.
<string.h>: For string handling functions.
<tgmath.h>: For type-generic math.
<threads.h>: For thread library.
<time.h>: For time/date utilities.
<uchar.h>: For UTF-16 and UTF-32 character utilities.
<wchar.h>: For wide character utilities.
<wctype.h>: To classify wide characters into several types. */
