/* The C Standard Library is composed of various headers, each performing unique functionalities:



<assert.h> - Compares its argument to zero.

<complex.h> - Performs complex number arithmetic.

<ctype.h> - Defines functions to identify the type of character data.

<errno.h> - Reports error conditions.

<fenv.h> - Manages the floating-point environment.

<float.h> - Defines limits of floating-point types.

<inttypes.h> - Handles format conversion of integer types.

<iso646.h> - Provides alternative operator spellings.

<limits.h> - States ranges of integer types.

<locale.h> - Provides localization utilities.

<math.h> - Contains common mathematics functions.

<setjmp.h> - Assists with nonlocal jumps.

<signal.h> - Manages signal handling.

<stdalign.h> - Offers alignas and alignof convenience macros.

<stdarg.h> - Aids in handling with variable arguments.

<stdatomic.h> - Handles atomic operations.

<stdbit.h> - Provides macros for working with byte and bit representations.

<stdbool.h> - Contains macros for the boolean type.

<stdckdint.h> - Offers macros for performing checked integer arithmetic.

<stddef.h> - Houses common macro definitions.

<stdint.h> - Specifies fixed-width integer types.

<stdio.h> - Supports input/output.

<stdlib.h> - Includes general utilities.

<stdnoreturn.h> - Contains the noreturn convenience macro.

<string.h> - Controls string handling.

<tgmath.h> - Provides type-generic math macros.

<threads.h> - Provides a thread library.

<time.h> - Assists with time/date utilities.

<uchar.h> - Supports UTF-16 and UTF-32 character utilities.

<wchar.h> - Defines extended multibyte and wide character utilities.

<wctype.h> - Defines functions for identifying the type within wide character data.
