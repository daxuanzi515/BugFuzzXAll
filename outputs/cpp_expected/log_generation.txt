[VERBOSE] /* The C++23 std::expected class is a template that can store either of two values.

If an expected is instantiated with a reference type, function type, or a specialization of std::unexpected, it becomes ill-formed. Type T cannot be std::in_place_t or std::unexpect_t.

[VERBOSE] /* The C++23 std::expected class is a template that can store either of two values. It always holds either an expected value of type T, or an unexpected value of type E, but is never valueless. The value is directly stored within the object's storage and does not require dynamic memory allocation.

If an expected is instantiated with a reference type, function type, or a specialization of std::unexpected, it becomes ill-formed. Type T cannot be std::in_place_t or std::unexpect_t.

The types T and E must follow certain criteria. T must either be (void, possibly cv-qualified) or meet Destructible requirements, E must be a valid template argument for std::unexpected, both should meet Destructible requirements.

The std::expected class provides functions for construction, destruction, value assignment and retrieval, checking for contained value, transforming the value, and swapping contents. It also provides helper classes for unexpected values and exceptions for checked access to an expected holding an unexpected value as well as monadic operations for handling expected and unexpected values.

The std::expected class can be used to easily handle both expected and unexpected values in a program and make operations on them more manageable and readable. It proves to be helpful especially in situations where functions could fail and return an error instead of the expected result. */

/* The std::expected<T> class is a non-standard class template which can hold an object of non-default type.

It provides a wrapper object that can either contain an object of one type (e.g., a double, int, short etc.) or an unexpected value of another type.
As an object of type `std::expected<T>` can contain only one of two values, it also disallows objects with const or volatile cv-qualifiers and forbids all specializations with references and pointers types.

Usually, you don’t explicitly instantiate it, instead you need it implicitly.
That’s why it’s possible to write a function or method with an expected that it will be instantiated depending on the type you provide it initially and will only instantiate it once during the first use of the function (this is why you can say that it’s lazy). So, an expected of type `std::expected<double>` won’t be instantiated if double is not used inside the function at all, otherwise it will be instantiated as `T = double`.

The default value of std::expected<T> is expected{ T() }, where T is not known.

[VERBOSE] /* The C++23 std::expected class is a template that can store either of two values. It always holds either an expected value of type T, or an unexpected value of type E, but is never valueless. The value is directly stored within the object's storage and does not require dynamic memory allocation.

If an expected is instantiated with a reference type, function type, or a specialization of std::unexpected, it becomes ill-formed. Type T cannot be std::in_place_t or std::unexpect_t.

The types T and E must follow certain criteria. T must either be (void, possibly cv-qualified) or meet Destructible requirements, E must be a valid template argument for std::unexpected, both should meet Destructible requirements.

The std::expected class provides functions for construction, destruction, value assignment and retrieval, checking for contained value, transforming the value, and swapping contents. It also provides helper classes for unexpected values and exceptions for checked access to an expected holding an unexpected value as well as monadic operations for handling expected and unexpected values.

The std::expected class can be used to easily handle both expected and unexpected values in a program and make operations on them more manageable and readable. It proves to be helpful especially in situations where functions could fail and return an error instead of the expected result. */

The value is directly stored within the object's storage and does not require dynamic memory allocation.

If an expected is instantiated with a reference type, function type, or a specialization of std::unexpected, it becomes ill-formed. Type T cannot be std::in_place_t or std::unexpect_t.

The types T and E must follow certain criteria. T must either be (void, possibly cv-qualified) or meet Destructible requirements, E must be a valid template argument for std::unexpected, both should meet Destructible requirements.

The std::expected class provides functions for construction, destruction, value assignment and retrieval, checking for contained value, transforming the value, and swapping contents. It also provides helper classes for unexpected values and exceptions for checked access to an expected holding an unexpected value as well as monadic operations for handling expected and unexpected values.

The std::expected class can be used to easily handle both expected and unexpected values in a program and make operations on them more manageable and readable. It proves to be helpful especially in situations where functions could fail and return an error instead of the expected result. */
