/* C++23, the upcoming new version of the C++ standard, introduces a number of significant features and updates to the programming language:

1. New Literal Suffixes: It adds literal suffixes for std::size_t and the corresponding signed type.

2. String Handling and Checking: It includes a member function "contains" for strings and string view, for checking if a string contains a specified substring or character.

3. Stacktrace Library: A new library added for stacktrace, based on Boost.Stacktrace.

4. Type Traits: Addition of the type trait, std::is_scoped_enum, and functions like std::to_underlying for handling enums.

5. Concurrency: Introduction of the <stdatomic.h> header, for interoperability with C atomics.

6. Range Library Changes: Extensive changes and additions to the range library which include new adaptors like views::join_with, and functions like ranges::to.

7. Constexpr Libraries: Many functions are now constexpr, allowing them to be evaluated at compile time, speeding up code execution.

8. String Streaming: Addition of a new std::span-based string-stream.

9. Unique and Optional Pointers: Making std::unique_ptr constexpr, and Monadic operations for std::optional.

10. Unicode Concepts: Directives for handling unicode characters.

11. Improved Output: Introducing std::print and std::println functions for better text output.

12. Removal and Deprecation: Some features like garbage collection support and features like std::aligned_storage and std::aligned_union have been deprecated as per the new update.

Many of these features were added during virtual WG21 meetings throughout 2020, 2021, and early 2022. The new features are intended to improve the performance and ease-of-use of C++. */
