/* The above passage details the multiple updates and additions made to the C++23 draft in various virtual WG21 meetings across 2020 to 2022. The changes include:

1. Introduction of Literal suffixes for std::size_t and the corresponding signed type.
2. A member function contains for std::basic_string and std::basic_string_view to check the presence of a given substring or character.
3. Addition of a stacktrace library based on Boost.Stacktrace and a type trait std::is_scoped_enum.
4. Features to repair input range adapters and counted_iterator, relax requirements for time_point::clock, and apply std::visit for classes derived from std::variant, among others.
5. Introduction of conditional noexcept specifications to std::exchange and monadic operations for std::optional.
6. Multiple changes in the ranges library, and an update for the character sets and encodings.
7. Function to mark unreachable code, making std::unique_ptr constexpr, support for pipe for user-defined range adaptors.
8. Reverting the deprecation of compound assignment to volatile variables, mandatory support for UTF-8 source files.
9. Introduction of flat_map and flat_set to the standard library, and std::generator implementing a coroutine generator.
10. Removed the garbage collection support added in C++11 and deprecated std::aligned_storage and std::aligned_union.

While many new features have been added, certain functions and features have also been deprecated or removed, reflecting the evolving nature of the programming language. */
