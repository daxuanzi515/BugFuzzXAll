/* The documentation presents the integrated changes in the latest draft of C23. Some main points include:

Standard Library:
- New functions have been added to the <string.h> and <stdlib.h> sections. These functions are for erasing sensitive data, efficiently concatenating strings, allocating copies of strings, and determining the byte alignment of a pointer. 
- Functions providing bit utility have been added under a new header, <stdbit.h>.
- A function to convert time structure into calendar time value has been added in <time.h>.
- Existing functions are enhanced such as the printf() and scanf() function families, the strtol() and wcstol() function families, and functions like bsearch() and bsearch_s() etc.

Preprocessor:
- New directives like #elifdef, #elifndef, #embed, #warning have been added for various purposes such as checking availability of header, attribute, etc. 

Types:
- Addition of a null pointer type, nullptr_t. 
- Bit-precise integers types _BitInt(N) have been added 
- Improved support for using const with arrays.

Constants:
- Certain constants have been added, such as 'wb and uwb integer literal suffixes for _BitInt(N) types, and binary literal constant prefixes, 0b, and 0B.

Keywords:
- New Keywords like true, false, alignas, alignof, bool, static_assert, thread_local, _BitInt, typeof, typeof_unqual, nullptr, constexpr, _Decimal32, _Decimal64, _Decimal128 have been added.

Syntax:
- Syntax has been changed allowing labels to appear before declarations, and unnamed parameters in function definitions.

Other features:
- Support for the ISO/IEC 60559:2020 for floating-point arithmetic.
- The constexpr specifier was added for objects, but not functions unlike C++.
- Additionally, it adds and clarifies encodings for char16_t strings and char32_t strings. 

In summary, the changes involve function addition, directive addition, type modification, keyword addition, syntax changes, and other feature enhancements. */
