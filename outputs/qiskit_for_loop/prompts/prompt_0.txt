'''The QuantumCircuit.for_loop() method in Qiskit's quantum circuit interface is used to create a for loop within the quantum circuit. The method can be overloaded. If the body parameter is not provided, the method returns a context manager that pushes a scope into the circuit. This context manager captures all gate calls and other scopes, tracking the resources used in the process, and builds the corresponding operation at the end. 

The method accepts several parameters like indexset (a collection of integers to loop over), loop_parameter (used within the body to which the values from indexset are assigned), body (loop body to be executed repeatedly), qubits, clbits (circuit qubits/clbits over which the loop body is run), and labels. 

The outcome of the method depends on the call signature. It could be a context manager for creating the for loop or an InstructionSet handle to the appended loop operation. If incorrect calling conventions are used, the method raises a CircuitError.'''
